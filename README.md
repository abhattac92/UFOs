Javascript, Bootstrap and UFOs

## Challenge
The purpose of this assignment was to create a Dynamic table from data stored in a javascript array and display it on a webpage using HTML. We also utilized bootstrap to customize the webpage and css to style our page to improve the user experience. We did this using the mediumm of UFO sightings and created severa filters to make the table dynamic as allow the webpage to dsiplay only the data the user chose. We used ES6+ in Javascript, HTML with bootstrap components and a jpg image from nasa in conjunction with css to style our page. By double clicking the index.html file, the webpage can be viewed. On recommendation I would make to further improve the project is possible to add webscraping component to continually update the data as more information is available. Afterall 2020 is the year of the UFOs!
